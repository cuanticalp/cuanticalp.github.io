- title:       Conditional states and entropy in qudit-qubit systems
  image:       bilkis.png
  description: We examine, in correlated mixed states of qudit-qubit systems, the set of all conditional qubit states that can be reached after local measurements at the qudit based on rank-1 projectors. While for a similar measurement at the qubit the conditional postmeasurement qudit states lie on the surface of an ellipsoid, for a measurement at the qudit we show that the set of postmeasurement qubit states can form more complex solid regions. In particular, we show the emergence, for some classes of mixed states, of sets which are the convex hull of solid ellipsoids and which may lead to conelike and trianglelike shapes in limit cases. We also analyze the associated measurement-dependent conditional entropy, providing a full analytic determination of its minimum and of the minimizing local measurement at the qudit for the previous states. Separable rank-2 mixtures are also discussed.

- title:       Parallel-in-time optical simulation of history states
  image:       parallel.png
  description: We present an experimental optical implementation of a parallel-in-time discrete model of quantum evolution, based on the entanglement between the quantum system and a finite-dimensional quantum clock. The setup is based on a programmable spatial light modulator which entangles the polarization and transverse spatial degrees of freedom of a single photon. It enables the simulation of a qubit history state containing the whole evolution of the system, capturing its main features in a simple and configurable scheme. We experimentally determine the associated system-time entanglement, which is a measure of distinguishable quantum evolution, and also the time average of observables, which in the present realization can be obtained through one single measurement.

- title:       History state formalism for Dirac's theory
  image:       nahuel.png
  description: We propose a history state formalism for a Dirac particle. By introducing a reference quantum clock system it is first shown that Dirac’s equation can be derived by enforcing a timeless Wheeler-DeWitt-like equation for a global state. The Hilbert space of the whole system constitutes a unitary representation of the Lorentz group with respect to a properly defined invariant product, and the proper normalization of global states directly ensures standard Dirac’s norm. Moreover, by introducing a second quantum clock, the previous invariant product emerges naturally from a generalized continuity equation. The invariant parameter τ associated with this second clock labels history states for different particles, yielding an observable evolution in the case of a hypothetical superposition of different masses. Analytical expressions for both the space-time density and electron-time entanglement are provided for two particular families of electron states, the former including Pryce localized particles.

- title:       Inducing critical phenomena in spin chains through sparse alternating fields
  image:       prbmarco.png
  description: We analyze the phase diagram of the exact ground state (GS) of spin-s chains with ferromagnetic XXZ couplings under n-alternating field configurations, i.e., sparse alternating fields having nodes at n−1 contiguous sites. It is shown that such systems can exhibit a nontrivial magnetic behavior, which can differ significantly from that of the standard (n=1) alternating case and enable mechanisms for controlling their magnetic and entanglement properties. The boundary in field space of the fully aligned phase can be determined analytically ∀n, and shows that it becomes reachable only above a threshold value of the coupling anisotropy Jz/J, which depends on n but is independent of the system size. Below this value, the maximum attainable magnetization becomes much smaller. We then show that the GS can exhibit significant magnetization plateaus, persistent for large systems, at which the magnetization per site m obeys the quantization rule 2n(s−m)=integer, consistent with the Oshikawa, Yamanaka, and Affleck criterion. We also identify the emergence of field-induced spin polymerization, which explains the presence of such plateaus. Entanglement and field-induced frustration effects are also analyzed.

- title:       History states of systems and operators
  image:       history.png
  description: We discuss some fundamental properties of discrete system-time history states. Such states arise for a quantum reference clock of finite dimension and lead to a unitary evolution of system states when satisfying a static discrete Wheeler-DeWitt-type equation. We consider the general case where system-clock pairs can interact, analyzing first their different representations and showing there is always a special clock basis for which the evolution for a given initial state can be described by a constant Hamiltonian H. It is also shown, however, that when the evolution operators form a complete orthogonal set, the history state is maximally entangled for any initial state, as opposed to the case of a constant H, and can be generated through a simple double-clock setting. We then examine the quadratic system-time entanglement entropy, providing an analytic evaluation and showing it satisfies strict upper and lower bounds determined by the energy spread and the geodesic evolution connecting the initial and final states. We finally show that the unitary operator that generates the history state can itself be considered as an operator history state, whose quadratic entanglement entropy determines its entangling power. Simple measurements on the clock enable one to efficiently determine overlaps between system states and also evolution operators at any two times.

- title:       Fermionic entanglement in the Lipkin model
  image:       lipkin.png
  description: We examine the fermionic entanglement in the ground state of the fermionic Lipkin model and its relation with bipartite entanglement. It is first shown that the one-body entanglement entropy, which quantifies the minimum distance to a fermionic Gaussian state, behaves similarly to the mean-field order parameter and is essentially proportional to the total bipartite entanglement between the upper and lower modes, a quantity meaningful only in the fermionic realization of the model. We also analyze the entanglement of the reduced state of four single-particle modes (two up-down pairs), showing that its fermionic concurrence is strongly peaked at the phase transition and behaves differently from the corresponding up-down entanglement. We finally show that the first measures and the up-down reduced entanglement can be correctly described through a basic mean-field approach supplemented with symmetry restoration, whereas the concurrence requires at least the inclusion of random-phase-approximation–type correlations for a proper prediction. Fermionic separability is also discussed.

- title:       Of Local Operations and Physical Wires
  image:       prxmauricio.png
  description: In this work (multipartite) entanglement, discord, and coherence are unified as different aspects of a single underlying resource theory defined through simple and operationally meaningful elemental operations. This is achieved by revisiting the resource theory defining entanglement, local operations, and classical communication (LOCC), placing the focus on the underlying quantum nature of the communication channels. Taking the natural elemental operations in the resulting generalization of LOCC yields a resource theory that singles out coherence in the wire connecting the spatially separated systems as an operationally useful resource. The approach naturally allows us to consider a reduced setting as well, namely, the one with only the wire connected to a single quantum system, which leads to discordlike resources. The general form of free operations in this latter setting is derived and presented as a closed form. We discuss in what sense the present approach defines a resource theory of quantum discord and in which situations such an interpretation is sound—and why in general discord is not a resource. This unified and operationally meaningful approach makes transparent many features of entanglement that in LOCC might seem surprising, such as the possibility to use a particle to entangle two parties, without it ever being entangled with either of them, or that there exist different forms of multipartite entanglement

  image:       prlmarco.png
  description: We analyze ground state (GS) factorization in general arrays of spins si with XXZ couplings immersed in nonuniform fields. It is shown that an exceptionally degenerate set of completely separable symmetry-breaking GSs can arise for a wide range of field configurations, at a quantum critical point where all GS magnetization plateaus merge. Such configurations include alternating fields as well as zero-bulk field solutions with edge fields only and intermediate solutions with zero field at specific sites, valid for d-dimensional arrays. The definite magnetization-projected GSs at factorization can be analytically determined and depend only on the exchange anisotropies, exhibiting critical entanglement properties. We also show that some factorization-compatible field configurations may result in field-induced frustration and nontrivial behavior at strong fields.
