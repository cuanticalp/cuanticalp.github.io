# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on fundamental theoretical quantum physics by means of
information-theoretic approaches.

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send an [email](mailto:rossigno@fisica.unlp.edu.ar).
