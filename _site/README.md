# About [QILP](https://qilp.org)

Welcome to the Quantum Information Research Group at the National University of La Plata.

We investigate the physics of many-body systems from the novel perspective of quantum information.

# Quantum Information Theory

We investigate, through the perspective of quantum information, a wide variety of physical systems: spin chains and arrays, Boson and Fermion systems, Gaussian states and even the concept of time in quantum mechanics. A common aspect is that the main characteristics of the different systems emerge from entanglement and quantum correlations (Quantum Discord, Generalized entropic measures).

# Collaboration with the Quantum Optics Lab

We consider it crucial to corroborate theoretical results through experiments, so we maintain a fluid collaboration with the quantum optics laboratory of the University of Buenos Aires LPI: [Laboratorio de Procesado de Im√°genes](http://loft.df.uba.ar/).
