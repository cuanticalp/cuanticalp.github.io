I"è<p>We investigate, through the perspective of quantum information, a wide variety of physical systems: spin chains and arrays, Boson and Fermion systems, Gaussian states and even the concept of time in quantum mechanics. A common aspect is that the main characteristics of the different systems emerge from entanglement and quantum correlations (Quantum Discord, Generalized entropic measures).</p>
